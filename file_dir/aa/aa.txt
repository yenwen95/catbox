Dear Sir, 

For your information, 

the things that have been done for now are: 
- login ,registration and password reset functions with email verification (These work on both localhost and the hosting website in 000webhost, Users register their account with email and password along with other user information. An email will send to them to verify their account. After verify their accounts by clicking the link provided in email,  then they can login with their email or username and their password. If they forget their password, they can click on the password reset button and enter their email so that the system will send password reset email to them. Users will be directed to a page to enter new password by clicking on the link provided in email. ).

Things that I think I have to do in this sembreak are: 
- designing the main page, login and registration pages properly in the real system with css and bootstrap
- building upload and delete function (The system will show the files in a list similar as Google Drive after successfully uploading, it will always shows out what files are stored in the database of a user, same for delete function)
- showing file information such as file name, file size and file type on the right panel when a file is selected 
-learning ReactJS (also try to apply into my system)

I think the problem that I am facing now is to understand ReactJS and apply it because I just started to learn.  There are also many knowledges that I do not know beside this ReactJS library. What I heard from an introduction video in Coursera, there also Routing, Redux, API which I do not actually know how they work in the real development. But I will continue to study from the course in Coursera ,Youtube and other resources. The small assignments and projects will help me to know more about them. 


That is all from my thoughts, if anything is insufficient or wrong, please correct me. 


Thank you for your time.
